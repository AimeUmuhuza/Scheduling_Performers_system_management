Final Exam
Project title: Scheduling Performers Management System

1.	Project Requirements

Scheduling Performers Managements System, is a system designed to effectively manage and coordinate the scheduling of performers for various music events or performances.
It provides a comprehensive platform that streamlines the entire process of performer scheduling, ensuring efficient organization and communication between event organizers and performers.

Key features and functionalities of the system:

Performer Database: the system maintains a centralized database containing detailed information about performers. This includes their names, email, genres, availability or time he/she will perform.

Event Scheduling: the system offers a user-friendly interface to manage performances. Event organizers can define event details such as date, time, duration, and venue. They can also select performers from the database and assign them to specific slots or stages within the event schedule.

Availability Management: The admin can update the performer availability within the system, indicating their preferred time slots, blackout date, or conflicts. This allows event organizers to schedule performers effectively and avoid double bookings or scheduling conflicts.

Conflicts Resolution: The system assists in identifying and resolving scheduling conflicts that may arise due to overlapping performers or unforeseen circumstances. 

2.	Project Plan: 
This project is mainly focus from contacting the artist performer until the end of the performance.

Here is the channel: we shall contact the Music artist through email sending him/her the details of the event attached with the contract. If he confirms to be with us in the event, we shall receive confirmation through our email attached with a signed contract; now weâ€™ll schedule the start time and end time of his/her performance according to the event timeline.
